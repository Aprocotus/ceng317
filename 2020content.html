   <ul>
    <li>In this course we build a circuit board for a computing node. It is an individual course such that each student acquires design experience. </li>
	<li>Please let me know if you are in a situation of financial need. Ordering the hardware for your design, even when sharing the costs with colleagues will cost you over $100. I compare this to a cost of a textbook but please do let me (firstname.lastname_at_humber.ca) know sooner rather than later if this may be a problem for you.</li>
   	<li>Hub and spokes distributed computing model. Connection from spokes can be via many different technologies: USB, I2C, SPI, UART, encrypted serial, 1-wire, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Cell, LoRa, Sigfox, DMX, CANbus, LINbus, EtherCAT, BACNet, Profinet, Modbus, IR, Zigbee, Z-Wave, LonTalk, Insteon, Powerline, Mesh, etc.

	<li>The connection technology that we will be using to a hub will be USB but the spoke itself may use other forms.<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/six0four/ceng317/master/images/1process2control.jpg"></li>
	<li>Discussion of platform (stm32f103c8t6).<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/six0four/ceng317/master/images/stm32f103c8t6.jpg"></li>
	<li>Overall project maximum dimensions of 12 13/16" x 6" x 2 7/8" (32.5cm x 15.25cm x 7.25cm) which represents the space below the tray in the parts kit.</li>
	<li>Project case to be designed for 3D printing/laser cutting.</li>
	<li>The highest AC voltage that will be used is 16Vrms from a wall adaptor from which +/- 15V or as high as 45 VDC can be obtained. Maximum power consumption will be 20 Watts.</li>
    <li>We work with prototypes and prototypes are not to be left powered unattended.</li>
    <li>Projects:
	 <ul>
	 0. CHOOSE a project of your own by the begining of class week 2 that:
	  <li>Uses a custom made and assembled PCB with a STM32F103C8T6 using https://libopencm3.org/ to create a USB device with a sensor (input device that senses the environment such as a keypad or temperature measurement) or an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_end_effector#Examples">effector</a> (output device that has an effect on the environment such as a display or motor) that communicates via serial to a computer.</li>
	  <li>Complete Project should be designable for <a href=https://www.seeedstudio.com/prototype-pcb-assembly.html">assembly</a> with parts from <a href=https://www.seeedstudio.com/opl.html">Open Parts List</a> in order to have project done in time to program/debug it and recieve a grade.</li>
	 </ul>
     <ol>

     Please choose one of these first come first serve on the blackboard discussion board corresponding to your section. Suggested combined PCBA orders for cost sharing:
     <ul>
	  <li>RTOS PCBA order subcircuits: 1-6</li>
      <li>Temperature logger PCBA order subcircuits: 7-11</li>
      <li>User interface PCBA order subcircuits: 12-16</li>
	 </ul>
    </li>
    <li>For the winter term (starting Jan 2021) our focus is on six areas of ongoing/continuing multi-year work. In these areas, we welcome brief project charters from industry that propose the scope, mandate, and contain the system specification (design approach and requirements).
	 <ol>
      <li>Facilities: Bicycle Rental/Parking Lot/Vision System</li>
      <li>Building Automation: Greenhouse/SolarPanel/Home</li>
      <li>Consumer: Entertainment Protocol DMX/Baby Monitoring Project</li>
      <li>Education: Robust Hackable Educational Project</li>
      <li>Robotics: Control/Navigation/Dashboard</li>
      <li>Health and Wellness: Wearable
     </ol>
	</li>
    <li>As an example, there was a time that one would go to a bicycle rental company's
		  shack, provide something of value as a deposit and the person working
	  	  at the shack would provide a bicycle on the understanding that you
		  would return it along with payment for the amount of time that you
		  used it in exchange for return of your deposit.   </li>
		  <img src="https://www.torontoisland.com/images/bike/IMG_1697.JPG">
	<li>Times have changed, now you use your smart phone to provide your
		  credit card information to the bicycle rental company and then you are
		  provided the code to unlock a bicycle and you are charged based on
		  when you next lock it up.	   </li>
		  <img src="https://humber.ca/staff/sites/default/files/sub-images/dropbike%20lake%20and%20north.jpg">
	<li>The Computer Engineering Technology capstone consists of creating
		  project similar to this. In this example there is a lock mechanism, a
		  set of buttons to enter a code, lights and sound to provide feedback.
		  In CENG 317, students learn how to build the spokes. In CENG 319,
		  students learn how to write the corresponding app.
		  In CENG 355, the group would package everything up together as a
		  functioning prototype.   </li>
