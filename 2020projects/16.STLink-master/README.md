# CENG 317 Proposal
1. Basic info
     1. Name: 
     2. Date: 
     3. Section:
     4. Sensor/Effector choice: STLink-master
2. I will make a USB serial device, that will be able to program STM32s, via [Seeed Studio assembly](https://www.seeedstudio.com/fusion_pcb.html). This can be connected via a USB cable to a PC and PuTTY can be used for debugging. It can then also be connected to a Pi via USB but not necessarily this term. 
3. Preliminary Bill of Materials
    1. OPL: [ShenZhen](https://www.seeedstudio.com/opl.html)
    2. MPN: STM32F103C8T6 
	3. Qty: 2
	4. Link: https://file.elecfans.com/web1/M00/B4/95/pIYBAF5ThT-AGBnKAB6dnCcpKF0763.pdf?filename=STM32F103C8T6.pdf
    5. Description:	IC MCU 32BIT 64KB FLASH 48LQFP
	6. Manufacturer: ST
	7. Package: LQFP-48
4. Specifications
    1. Voltage range:
	2. Current draw:
	3. Protocol: SWD
	4. Footprint: BluePill Board provided in Fritzing example file.
	5. STM32 Pins used: GND, Main Target maybe needs a connection to NRST, STLink uses PA0, PA5, PB0, PB12, PB13, PB14.
	6. Additional components needed: 2 full BluePill devices needed, 220 Ohm resistor, two 4.7k Ohm resistors for a voltage divider.
